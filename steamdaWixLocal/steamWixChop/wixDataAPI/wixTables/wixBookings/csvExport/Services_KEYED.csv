Through play and design tasks, students will learn without even knowing it!



Our five day virtual camps take place Monday-Friday. The daily schedules combine fun, engaging workshops with instructor support sessions. 

Students meet with instructors four times a day where challenges and concepts are discussed, tools and materials are reviewed, and challenges are presented. Each meeting is ~30 minutes and our educators are available during independent building time.

No hunting for a stapler, everything you need is in your box!  A STEAM toolkit is included with your first week’s tuition (valued at $70) and contains all the tools (scissors, glue guns, etc) for the week. These tools will be used multiple times during the week.

Students also receive a box with all of the materials they need to successfully complete four workshops a day. They are each labeled with the day and the workshop number. There is also an insert that has the workshop and the items included and educators will guide the students on when to open them.

Each student will receive a Google log-in for the week where they can access Google Classroom, Google Meet, as well as the Google Suite. This is included with the cost of the program.","Experience Edutainment","/bookings-checkout/june-21-25-virtual-camp-full-day","/bookings-checkout/june-21-25-virtual-camp-full-day/book","Pricing Varies","june-21-25-virtual-camp-full-day","FREE",false,0,0,,20,1,"{""fields"":[{""_id"":""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002"",""type"":""email"",""label"":""Parent Email"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003"",""type"":""tel"",""label"":""Parent Phone Number"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001"",""type"":""text"",""label"":""Parent Full Name"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000008"",""type"":""text"",""label"":""Student 1 Full Name"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""78f2b45e-89d5-400b-b18d-541d1092a8ff"",""type"":""text"",""label"":""Student 1 Grade"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""3bc0bde5-2d60-491d-b311-a67ad690b039"",""type"":""text"",""label"":""Student 1 Age"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""e7239d21-388a-4a64-8d5a-e620775cce74"",""type"":""text"",""label"":""Current School"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":false}},{""_id"":""24357d07-2180-46e7-8210-ec9116244473"",""type"":""checkbox"",""label"":""Is this your first virtual week?"",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""84e4ae3f-1b3d-4785-b087-d872dbf3c293"",""type"":""checkbox"",""label"":""I certify that I am the legal guardian of this participant and I am allowing him/her to participate in the STEAM Discovery Academy."",""link"":null,""constraints"":{""required"":true}},{""_id"":""00bf7cf6-d237-4167-96a3-bf8cd3f717fc"",""type"":""checkbox"",""label"":""I agree to the Terms & Conditions"",""link"":{""url"":""https://www.steamda.com/cancellationT&Cs"",""text"":""View Terms""},""constraints"":{""required"":true}}]}","/services/","/services/june-21-25-virtual-camp-full-day"
